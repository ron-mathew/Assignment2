This Java program consists of three classes: UserInput, ArrayFunctions, and Main, which together handle user input, perform array operations, and display results.

1. UserInput Class:
arrayInput(): Reads five integers from the user and stores them in an array.
2. ArrayFunctions Class:
display(ArrayList<Integer> array): Prints the contents of an ArrayList.
evenOdd(int[] array): Separates even and odd numbers from the input array and displays them.
mindiff(int[] array): Finds the index of the first number in the smallest absolute difference pair in the array.
arrayToList(int[] array): Converts an integer array into an ArrayList<Integer>.
listToArray(ArrayList<Integer> list): Converts an ArrayList<Integer> back into an integer array.
3. Main Class (Entry Point):
Reads an array from the user.
Separates and prints even and odd numbers.
Finds and prints the index of the first element in the smallest difference pair.
Converts the array to an ArrayList and prints it.
Converts the ArrayList back to an array and prints it.
This program demonstrates fundamental Java concepts such as arrays, ArrayList, loops, user input handling, and simple mathematical operations.
